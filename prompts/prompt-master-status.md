# Site OS Prompt Master Status

This file is the source of truth for all active Site OS prompt versions, lock decisions, and status.

Update this file whenever a prompt version changes, a lock decision is made, or a benchmark test is completed.

---

## Workflow Continuity Rule

Unresolved client data does not stop the Site OS workflow.

When client data, form endpoints, production domain, or infrastructure items are unresolved:

- Flag each item clearly.
- Carry each item forward in the relevant prompt output.
- Document each item as AWAITING CLIENT CONFIRMATION, AWAITING INFRASTRUCTURE, or AWAITING APPROVAL.
- Continue the workflow for planning, drafting, benchmark testing, QA, and controlled development.
- Resolve all flagged items before production launch approval.

Production launch approval requires all carry-forward items to be resolved. Benchmark readiness, development QA, and pre-launch structural review do not.

Current Version: v2.1  
Status: Core Mode Build Master — Locked  
Benchmark: Benchmark 1  
Latest Result: PASS  
Validation Type: Supervised simulation validation + Live repository validation (Live Validation 02)  
Approved For: Core Mode service page builds, Next.js 14 App Router service pages, local SEO service pages, AEO-ready page builds

### Lock Decision

Prompt 06 v2.1 is approved and locked as the Core Mode Build Master.

### Required Controls Confirmed

- Execution depth selection
- Gate 1 project inspection hard stop
- Gate 2 build plan hard stop
- Unknown-framework halt rule
- AggregateRating master rule (no fake ratings invented at any point)
- Form field source rule (no endpoint invented without confirmation)
- LocalBusiness schema field protection (placeholder/flag rule for all unconfirmed fields)
- HowTo schema conditional
- Navigation scope rule
- robots.txt rule
- Page-specific validation placeholder rule
- Final v2.1 quality gate
- npm run build — PASS
- npm run lint — PASS

### Carry-Forward Behavior

Prompt 06 v2.1 correctly flags all unresolved client data as TODO in project files and reports them in the implementation report. These items are carried forward to Prompt 07 QA review. They do not stop the build.

### Production Requirement

Prompt 06 may complete a build with flagged TODOs. Those TODOs must be resolved before production launch approval at Prompt 09.

---

## Prompt 07: QA Review Prompt

Current Version: v1.2  
Status: Core Mode QA Review Master — Locked  
Benchmark: Benchmark 1  
Latest Result: PASS  
Validation Type: Supervised simulation-context QA validation + Live Validation 02 QA review  
Approved For: Core Mode QA reviews, post-build page reviews, simulation QA reviews, prompt behavior evaluations, schema safety audits, form/CTA review, SEO/AEO/GEO QA checks, accessibility and mobile readiness review

### Lock Decision

Prompt 07 v1.2 is approved and locked as the Core Mode QA Review Master.

### What Changed in v1.2

Added Unresolved Client Data Handling Rule. Unresolved items are flagged, documented, and carried forward in the Flagged Items Carry-Forward section. The QA review continues for all sections that do not depend on missing data.

Added CONDITIONALLY APPROVED as a release decision option. This allows the workflow to continue when the implementation is structurally sound and brief-aligned but client data or infrastructure items remain unresolved.

Added Flagged Items Carry-Forward as a required QA category (category 20).

### Required Controls Confirmed

- Execution depth selection
- Gate 1 QA scope inspection hard stop
- Simulation-context handling rule
- Gate 2 brief alignment hard stop
- QA category scoring
- Schema review
- Form and CTA review
- SEO/AEO/GEO review
- Accessibility and mobile review
- Validation command review
- Unresolved client data handling
- Flagged items carry-forward
- Release decision

### Carry-Forward Behavior

Prompt 07 v1.2 documents all unresolved items and carries them forward. The release decision reflects the current state accurately. CONDITIONALLY APPROVED confirms structural readiness while documenting what must be resolved before production launch.

### Production Requirement

APPROVED or APPROVED WITH MINOR REFINEMENTS may only be issued after actual files, routes, metadata, schema, forms, accessibility, mobile behavior, and build validation are confirmed clean and all flagged items are resolved.

---

## Prompt 08: Production Fix and TODO Resolution Prompt

Current Version: v1.1  
Status: Core Mode Production Fix Master — Locked  
Benchmark: Benchmark 1  
Latest Result: PASS  
Validation Type: Core Mode production fix validation with missing client data  
Approved For: Core Mode production fix sessions, TODO resolution, client data replacement, schema fix, form endpoint connection, sitemap and robots.txt creation, accessibility and mobile fixes, validation re-run

### Lock Decision

Prompt 08 v1.1 is approved and locked as the Core Mode Production Fix Master.

### What Changed in v1.1

Added Unresolved Client Data Handling Rule. Missing client data defers specific fixes without stopping the entire fix session. All safe fixes proceed. Unresolved items are documented and carried forward to Prompt 09.

Added Carry-Forward Items as a required report section.

Updated production readiness language to reflect that safe fixes may be completed while unresolved launch-critical items remain flagged for final launch QA.

### Required Controls Confirmed

- Execution depth selection
- Gate 1 fix scope inspection hard stop
- Gate 2 fix plan hard stop
- Client data safety rule
- Schema safety rule
- Form fix rule
- SEO and indexing fix rule
- Navigation fix rule
- Validation command reporting
- Unresolved client data handling
- Carry-forward items documentation
- Release recommendation

### Carry-Forward Behavior

Prompt 08 v1.1 proceeds with all safe fixes. Unresolved items are documented with their status and next required action. They are carried forward to Prompt 09 Final Launch QA.

### Production Requirement

READY FOR FINAL QA or a similar readiness recommendation may only be issued after all safe fixes are complete and all remaining unresolved items are clearly documented. Production launch requires Prompt 09 approval with all carry-forward items resolved, confirmed, or intentionally deferred with documented approval.

---

## Prompt 09: Final Launch QA Prompt

Current Version: v1  
Status: Core Mode Final Launch QA Master — Locked  
Benchmark: Benchmark 1  
Latest Result: PASS  
Validation Type: Final launch gate validation with missing client data and incomplete production infrastructure  
Approved For: Core Mode final launch QA, production release gating, launch blocker review, client-data-safe launch approval decisions

### Lock Decision

Prompt 09 v1 is approved and locked as the Core Mode Final Launch QA Master.

### Required Controls Confirmed

- Execution depth selection
- Gate 1 launch scope inspection hard stop
- Gate 2 launch blocker review hard stop
- Client data final safety rule
- Schema final safety rule
- Form final launch rule
- SEO and indexing final launch rule
- Accessibility and mobile final launch rule
- Validation command reporting
- Launch score and release decision

### Validation Result

Prompt 09 v1 was tested after:

- Prompt 06 v2.1 built the page
- Prompt 07 v1.1 reviewed the implementation
- Prompt 08 v1 reviewed production blockers

No confirmed client data was available during the test.

Prompt 09 correctly determined the page was BLOCKED BY CLIENT DATA and did not approve launch.

### Production Requirement

Prompt 09 may only approve production launch when all of the following are confirmed:

- No critical TODO or FLAG placeholders remain in production-facing files
- Phone number and tap-to-call links are real and tested
- Business address, ZIP, and hours are confirmed where used
- Form endpoint is real, connected, and tested
- Production domain is confirmed
- Canonical and Open Graph URLs use the production domain
- Sitemap includes the target route
- robots.txt does not block the target route
- Schema is valid and safe
- FAQPage schema matches visible FAQ content
- HowTo schema only exists when visible steps support it
- AggregateRating and Review schema are absent unless verified review data exists
- Build, lint, and type validation pass
- Accessibility and mobile QA are completed
- Internal links resolve
- Deployment and indexing requirements are complete

If critical client data or launch infrastructure is missing, Prompt 09 must return one of:

- BLOCKED BY LAUNCH TODOs
- BLOCKED BY CLIENT DATA
- BLOCKED BY TECHNICAL FAILURES

## Prompt 10: Client Data Collection and Production Values Prompt

Current Version: v1  
Status: Core Mode Client Data Collection Master — Locked  
Benchmark: Benchmark 1  
Latest Result: PASS  
Validation Type: Client intake, production values, schema readiness, launch blocker prevention validation  
Approved For: Core Mode client intake, production data collection, schema data collection, website planning data readiness, pre-build issue flagging, production values review

### Lock Decision

Prompt 10 v1 is approved and locked as the Core Mode Client Data Collection and Production Values Master.

### Required Controls Confirmed

- Execution depth selection
- Gate 1 source review hard stop
- Gate 2 data confirmation plan hard stop
- Client data safety rule
- Business identity collection
- Contact data collection
- Address and location data collection
- Business hours collection
- Services and service area collection
- Website architecture data collection
- CTA and conversion path collection
- Form and lead capture collection
- Brand and design data collection
- SEO and keyword data collection
- AEO, FAQ, and LLM readiness data collection
- Schema data collection
- Social proof and trust data collection
- Legal and compliance data collection
- Analytics, tracking, and indexing data collection
- Hosting, domain, and deployment data collection
- Client approval and review data collection
- Minimum Viable Data Set
- Production values summary
- Client questions
- Readiness recommendation

### Minimum Viable Data Set

Before production work proceeds, Prompt 10 should collect or flag:

- Business phone number
- Business address or approved service-area-only status
- ZIP code
- Business hours
- Production domain
- Form endpoint or confirmed lead capture path
- Privacy policy URL or requirement to create one
- Service list confirmation
- Service area confirmation
- Primary CTA confirmation

### Carry-Forward Behavior

Prompt 10 identifies confirmed values, missing values, values needing client confirmation, values that should not be used until verified, launch-critical flagged items, and recommended next actions.

Prompt 10 does not invent missing production data. It may allow planning, benchmark testing, and controlled development to continue when flagged issues are documented.

### Production Requirement

Prompt 10 must not mark a client data package production-ready unless the minimum viable data set and launch-critical fields are resolved, confirmed, or intentionally deferred with documented approval.

## Prompt 11: SERP Competitive Analysis Prompt

Current Version: v1.1  
Status: Supporting SERP Competitive Analysis Master — Locked  
Benchmark: Benchmark 1  
Latest Result: PASS  
Validation Type: SERP competitive analysis behavior validation + routing and scoring confirmation  
Approved For: SERP competitive analysis, search dominance review, competitor pattern analysis, content gap analysis, AEO and People Also Ask opportunity discovery, local/GEO competitive review, schema opportunity review, trust and conversion gap analysis

### Lock Decision

Prompt 11 v1.1 is approved and locked as the Supporting SERP Competitive Analysis Master.

Prompt 11 v1 passed the initial SERP competitive analysis validation using Benchmark 1.

Prompt 11 v1.1 added and confirmed:

- Canonical prompt identity
- Canonical file path
- Prompt 08 routing clarification
- Legacy naming handling for old SERP prompt references
- SERP Analysis Score Guidance
- No-invention behavior
- No final competitive dominance claim without live SERP review

### Validation Result

Prompt 11 v1.1 confirmation test result:

PASS.

The confirmation test verified that Prompt 11 v1.1:

- Identifies itself as the canonical SERP Competitive Analysis prompt
- Uses the canonical file path `prompts/11-serp-competitive-analysis-prompt.md`
- Clarifies that Prompt 08 is reserved for Production Fix and TODO Resolution
- Treats old `prompts/08-serp-competitive-analysis-prompt.md` references as legacy naming
- Includes SERP Analysis Score Guidance
- Does not penalize missing competitor-specific facts when live SERP data is unavailable and findings are properly labeled
- Requires unverified findings to be marked NOT VERIFIED, PARTIALLY VERIFIED, or REQUIRES LIVE SERP REVIEW
- Does not claim final competitive dominance without live SERP review

### Research Safety Rule

Prompt 11 must not invent:

- Competitor names
- Ranking positions
- Search volume
- Keyword difficulty
- Review counts
- Rating values
- Local pack positions
- Backlink data
- Competitor schema
- Competitor traffic
- Client pricing
- Same-day availability
- Licenses
- Guarantees

When live SERP data is unavailable, Prompt 11 may continue with strategy-based competitive analysis, but all competitor-specific findings must be clearly labeled as NOT VERIFIED, PARTIALLY VERIFIED, or REQUIRES LIVE SERP REVIEW.

### Carry-Forward Behavior

Prompt 11 carries unresolved research items forward to Prompt 04, Prompt 05, or a future live SERP review as appropriate.

Prompt 11 does not stop analysis when live SERP data is unavailable if enough keyword, service, location, or page context exists. It clearly separates strategy-based competitive readiness from verified live SERP dominance.

### Final Decision

PASS.

Prompt 11 v1.1 is ready for use as the Supporting SERP Competitive Analysis Master.

## Prompt 20: Visibility and Conversion Alignment Prompt

Current Version: v1.2  
Status: Supporting Visibility and Conversion Alignment Master — Locked  
Benchmark: Lightweight confirmation test  
Latest Result: PASS WITH FLAGGED ITEMS (non-blocking)  
Validation Type: Initial validation pass + v1.1 lightweight confirmation test + v1.2 lightweight confirmation test  
Approved For: Visibility and conversion alignment review, SEO/GEO/AEO/SERP/LLM visibility review, AI citation-readiness alignment, technical SEO and indexing review, internal linking alignment, trust and CTA flow review, conversion path review, competitive outperformance alignment, multi-platform readiness review, and pre-build alignment gate review.

### Lock Decision

Prompt 20 v1.2 is approved and locked as the Supporting Visibility and Conversion Alignment Master.

Prompt 20 v1 initially received a patch decision and an initial score of 61 / 100.

Prompt 20 was patched to v1.1 and passed lightweight confirmation testing; v1.1 was locked as the Supporting Visibility and Conversion Alignment Master.

Prompt 20 was then patched to v1.2 to add the Secondary Position routing and to add Prompt 05 Developer Build Brief to the does-not-replace list. The v1.2 lightweight confirmation test returned PASS WITH FLAGGED ITEMS — all 9 checks passed, with one non-blocking flagged note about a forward-looking next-step instruction inside the prompt file itself.

### v1.2 Patch Notes

Prompt 20 v1.2 extends v1.1 with two workflow-position refinements:

- Added a Secondary Position: after Prompt 04 Gap Fix and before Prompt 05 Developer Build Brief, when Prompt 20 is used as a pre-build alignment gate review.
- Added Prompt 05 Developer Build Brief to the does-not-replace list so the new Secondary Position cannot be misread as a replacement for the developer build brief.

### Required Controls Confirmed

- Canonical identity header
- Expanded Page Details input block (including Analytics Context, Known SERP/Competitor Context, Proof/Trust/Business Context)
- Execution Depth selector
- Routing Rule section (with Prompt 05 in does-not-replace)
- Primary Position and Secondary Position workflow declarations
- Unavailable Data Handling section
- Analytics Unavailability Rule reference
- Do Not Invent section
- Final Alignment Decision section
- Carry-Forward Items section
- Required Output Format section
- No guaranteed outcome claim rule

### Carry-Forward Behavior

Prompt 20 v1.2 flags unresolved analytics, SERP, competitor, schema, internal linking, conversion, proof, and trust data items rather than inventing them. Each flagged item carries forward with a status label, a blocking-or-not flag, and a recommended next action. Prompt 20 does not stop alignment review when source data is unavailable if enough page context exists.

### Production Requirement

Prompt 20 produces an alignment review report, not a build deliverable. Final production launch approval still requires Prompt 09 with all carry-forward items resolved, confirmed, or intentionally deferred with documented approval.
